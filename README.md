This E-commerce Analysis project focuses on extracting actionable business insights from real-world e-commerce data by analyzing customer behavior, sales trends, delivery performance, and payment methods. The project involved data cleaning, transformation, KPI development, and exploratory analysis using SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. Key insights revealed that most purchases occur on weekdays, credit cards dominate customer satisfaction, faster delivery leads to higher review scores, and pricing behavior varies by customer location and product category. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in handling messy datasets, optimizing dashboards, and translating raw data into meaningful visual insights to support data-driven decision-making.
